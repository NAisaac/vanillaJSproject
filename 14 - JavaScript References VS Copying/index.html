    /**
    let original = ***;
    let unoriginal = original;

    copy: strings, numbers, and booleans
    reference: arrays, objects

    When copied, changing the unoriginal doesn't change the original
    When referenced, changing the unoriginal does change the original

    SO let's look at how to copy arrays and objects with vanilla JS
    **/

    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // PLAYERS ARRAY IS UPDATED!!!
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heeee hawww';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    // LOL: poor man's version of deep copy
    // turn the object into a JSON string, and then parse back to an object
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
